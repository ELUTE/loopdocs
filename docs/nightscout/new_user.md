# New Nightscout Users

Two options exist for easy hosting of NS; Azure or Heroku. Both hosting services are free.  However,  Azure has data quotas monthly and shorter-term CPU quotas.  If you exceed those quotas, you may be facing a monthly data-use bill or being locked out of NS for about 12 hours until the quotas reset.  As you start to use NS more intensively for alarms, pebble watches, etcâ€¦it is possible that you may exceed your monthly data cap on Azure.  Many Loop users have transitioned their old sites from Azure over to Heroku and have found the hosting change to be beneficial.  Heroku also has some memory limits, but those limits have been more than adequate for Loop users.  Therefore, we recommend new users start with Heroku.
